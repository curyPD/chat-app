# Messengr

A browser messenger application featuring user profile customization, multiple sign-in options, dark mode settings,
user search, chat filtering, image uploads, message editing, and responsive design. Here's the [link](https://messengr-alpha.netlify.app).

I built the UI with React.js and TailwindCSS, integrated Firebase to allow user authentication and ensure real-time updates on the client-side, and used Vite as the build tool.
